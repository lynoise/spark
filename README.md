Spark
=====

Spark is Furore's public domain FHIR server build in C#.

Spark implements a major part of the FHIR specification and has been used and tested during the past 
HL7 WGM Connectathons. Furore and the community, will keep enhancing this server to support the latest versions
and add functionality, but we welcome   who wants to support this effort and help us make Spark a 
better reference platform and  and playground for FHIR.
